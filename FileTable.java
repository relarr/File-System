 * File (Structure) Table is a class which represents the set of file table entries. Each file table entry represents
 * one file descriptor. The main purpose of this class is to create a new file table entry when it is required and then
 * add that to the Vector of file table entry. It removes the file table entry from Vector when it is freed.
